# Pymrio_development
Contributions to the development of Pymrio

The purpose of this script is to use the Pymrio, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib libraries to: Parse the EXIOBASE3 data, loop through the data and collect relevent time series data on GHG emissions (as well as other enviornmental stressors) per country and store this information in a table and produce visualizations. 

The file "Main.py" includes the script for a program based on user input. Other files include the get_emissions functions using Pymrio and Numpy.
